# hw-challenge-2

## Description

My motivation for this assignment was to refine my HTML and CSS skills. I built this project to prove to myself that I can put together an amazing portfolio to showcase my skillset thus far. Now that I finally have a portfolio I'm able to display my work to peers and potential recruiters.
